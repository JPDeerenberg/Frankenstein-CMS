# Do NOT put them in this file. Run these commands instead:
#
# npx wrangler secret put CLIENT_PASSWORD
# (e.g., the password you give your client: purple-banana-123)
#
# npx wrangler secret put GITHUB_TOKEN
# (e.g., your fine-grained GitHub access token)

[vars]
# Any public variables you want to set
